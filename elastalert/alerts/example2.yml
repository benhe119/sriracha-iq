# Doesn't send an actual alert to outside reciever (i.e. email, slack, or jira)
alert:
- command

## Elastalert isn't really meant to be used on static datasets, 
## but rahter is designed for live streams of data. To make it 
## work in our use case, we set a huge buffer_time which makes it 
## run over a long period of time & realert to 0, so each match
## in the buffer_time generates its own alert
